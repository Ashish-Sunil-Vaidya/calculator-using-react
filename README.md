# Calculator v2.0.0

## Description

The **Calculator** is a simple calculator application inspired by the design of Samsung Calculator and Microsoft Calculator. It was my first React project, created a long time ago.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- User-friendly interface with a familiar design.
- Built using React, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- Version 2.0.0 includes performance improvements, optimizations, bug fixes, and visual improvements.
- Change the theme to light or dark according to your preference.
- Every successful input is saved in your input history.
- History data is stored in your local storage, so accidental refreshes won't affect it.

## How to Use

1. Enter numbers and operators using the on-screen buttons or directly in the input field.
2. The result will be displayed in the calculator's output area, which you can edit if needed.
3. Use the clear button to reset the calculator if needed.
4. Utilize the backspace button to remove characters from right to left.
5. Clicking on an item in the history appends it to the current input.
